# F1TV and ESPN+ Live Chat 💬

## JavaScript Chrome Extension

### Description 📚

This project is a Google Chrome extension to embedd a Twitch chat into the official F1TV viewer or ESPN+ viewer. It will automatically connect to the chatroom to either the LiveChatUFC or LiveChatF1 channels I have created on Twitch. There will be a pop-up configuration option to toggle the Chat on or off, or use the embedded button that now exists in each of the player's controls.

### Infrastructure 🏗️

Built using vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and embed the offical Twitch Chat iFrame into the players. Some simple HTML and CSS was also used to write the extension's pop-up.
