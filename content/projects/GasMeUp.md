# GasMeUp ⛽

## React Native App

### Description 📚

An app to make splitting rides easier for everyone. A service to easily calculate your due gas-money and split easily to your riders. Just put in your riders, your route, and we will do the rest.

### Infrastructure 🏗️

The front end of this app was written in React Native and built using the Expo project manager. The backend is a Node.js server that hosts an Express API that the client can fetch data from. On this server we calculate the distances of routes and provide autocomplete location suggestions by utilizing the Google Maps API. The server also fetches current gas prices from my [Gas Price API](https://rapidapi.com/mmcardle-drx9FYQNK/api/canadian-gas-prices/).
