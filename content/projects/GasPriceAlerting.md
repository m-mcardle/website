# Gas Price Alerts Service ⛽

## Amazon SNS and Ruby Script

### Description 📚

Notification service to let subscribers know when local gas prices are predicted to experience a large change.

### Infrastructure 🏗️

Built using the AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS). The code execution itself was done through a simple Ruby script that fetches and parses responses from my [Gas Price API](https://rapidapi.com/mmcardle-drx9FYQNK/api/canadian-gas-prices/).
