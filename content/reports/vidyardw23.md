### Welcome!

On this page I will be going into great detail about my co-op placement during my second term at the amazing Kitchener company Vidyard.

### About Vidyard

[Vidyard](https://vidyard.com/) is a software company based in Kitchener which provides tools for the modern-day professional. They specialize primarily in providing value through video tooling which provides thorough analytics to enable their users to qualify their leads based on engagement with their video content. It was founded by two University of Waterloo students in 2010 as their Capstone Project, and the company still has a very Waterloo-centric culture. As a co-op not from the University of Waterloo, I found myself in a great opportunity to show the company that there are amazing students from all universities across Canada and made it a goal of mine to help open the door for future applicants from the University of Guelph.

### Dashboard

The main infrastructure I would end up working with was known as Dashboard. This essentially was the web application that our users would access to navigate to their library of videos, view analytics, manage user accounts, and more. The Dashboard repository was written using the Ruby on Rails framework for the backend and Vue.js for the front end. Both of these frameworks were new to me, so I was very excited to work with them and learn!

### My Team

I joined during an interesting time for the company as engineering was going through a major reorganization. When I joined it was the first week of my team's formal existence as the Sales Track team. This team was put together to focus on our analytics service as well as developing monitors for the health of our platform. Of course, because a team of developers will never accept their formal name, my team decided to internally call ourselves the **Star Track** team.

### Kudos

I would now like to take some time to thank some of the amazing people who have had an impact on me throughout the term. Vidyard is full of amazing people who all deserve recognition, but for the sake of keeping this brief, I'll only go into detail about three of them.


Arjun, Kyle K., Kevin, and Kyle D. for supporting me at the gala


### Conclusion

Overall, I was blown away with the amazing opportunities presented to me throughout my co-op term and feel so fortunate to be surrounded by such awesome people and such cool technology. This co-op term was an amazing four months of sharpening my front-end skills, getting my first real leadership experience, and lots of fun! I am so thankful I got great experience with powerful tech such as Vue, Ruby on Rails, Cypress, Vuex, Datadog, and Launch Darkly. After another successful co-op term, I cannot wait to see what my next placement will hold!
